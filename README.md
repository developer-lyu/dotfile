# Dotfile

## What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system. You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a periodâ€“a dot! The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.  This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.

## Useful configurations of mine

* [Vim](.config/.vimrc)
* NeoVim

## How to manage your own dotfiles

There are a hundred ways to manage your dotfiles. Personally, I use the **git bare repository method** for managing my dotfiles. Here is an article about this method of managing your dotfiles: [ https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/]( https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)
